### Details
> The PIR sensors can take 10-60 seconds to calibrate.\
> I've had set the code to wait 60 seconds as this is the time I've had the best experience with.\
> While the PIR sensor is calibrating don't be in it's view for the best results.

### Extras
> The .ckt files are actual copies of the images above where the circuits can be viewed and edited in Cirkit Designer.\
> This program can be downloaded [here](https://www.cirkitstudio.com/).\
> This part isn't important for getting this circuit to work. This is just the software I used to model the circuits.
